\textit{Pick two of the following three.  You cannot pick the third when you level up.  Only the Janitor can pick these moves.}
%
\br[1mm]
%
\begin{move}{Supply Closets}
When you’re inside the Bureau, or another building you’ve previously worked within, and need something that you could conceivably find in your janitorial supplies, there is a nearby supply closet that has it.
\br[2mm]
If you \textbf{need something that isn’t normally found in janitorial supplies}, open the nearest supply closet and roll +Weird.  On a 10+ it’s there, just like you needed.  On a miss, there’s something in the closet you aren’t going to like.  On a 7-9, both.
\end{move}%
\br[2mm]
%
\begin{move}{The Janitor Always Has The Keys}
When you need access to a part of the Bureau, or another building you’ve previously worked within, you either already have a set of keys that unlock the doors, or you know an alternate way through the building to get to the same spot, the Keeper will tell you which one.
\end{move}%
\br[2mm]
%
\begin{move}{Always Paying Attention}
Take two moves from any unused playbook.
\end{move}
%
}{% -- pg.1/2 col.3/3
%
\textit{Then pick two of these:}\\
%
\begin{move}{Oops!}
If you want to \textbf{stumble across something important}, tell the Keeper. You will find something important and useful, although not necessarily related to your immediate problems.
\end{move}%
\br[1mm]
%
\begin{move}{Let's Get Out of Here!}
If you can \textbf{protect someone} by telling them what to do, or by leading them out, roll +Charm instead of +Tough.
\end{move}%
\br[1mm]
%
\begin{move}{Through the Air Ducts}
When \textbf{you need to escape}, name the route you’ll try and roll +Sharp. On a 10+ you’re out of danger, no problem. On a 7-9 you can go or stay, but if you go it’s going to cost you (you leave some-thing behind or something comes with you). On a miss, you are caught halfway out.
\end{move}%
\br[1mm]
%
\begin{move}{The Power of Heart}
When fighting a monster, if you \textbf{help someone}, don’t roll +Cool. You automatically help as though you’d rolled a 10.
\end{move}%
\br[1mm]
%
\begin{move}{Don't Worry, I'll Check It Out}
Whenever you go off by yourself to check out somewhere (or something) scary or dangerous, mark experience.
\end{move}%
\br[1mm]
%
\begin{move}{So Much Work To Do}
While inside the oldest house, you heal faster than normal people. Any time your harm gets healed, heal an extra point. You are immune to all the harm move effects under ‘0-harm’ and ‘1-harm’ (when the Keeper would apply these, you ignore it).
\end{move}%
\br[1mm]
%
\begin{move}{Just Another Day}
When you have to \textbf{act under pressure} due to an altered item, phenomenon, or paranormal effect, you may roll +Weird instead of +Cool.

\begin{pbsect}{TALISMAN}[]
You have an Object of Power that helps or protects you. Define it, and its power, with the Keeper’s agreement. The object is one of: a janitorial supply item, a discrete and old piece of electronics, or something that plays music.  The Bureau is not aware that this is an object of power, or that you have objects of power in your possession.

\begin{pbsect}{HOUSEKEEPER}
You may not always know what the people in the Bureau are doing, or why they’re doing it, but no one knows the oldest house itself like you do.  Whenever you ask the Keeper where a place or thing is located inside the house, even if that location is supposed to be secret, even if the house has shifted, they will tell you where it is (or is supposed to be).

    {Ask or tell the Keeper about a ritual or procedure employees use to control or work within the oldest house.  You now know as much as any other bureau employee about it, and are able to reproduce the effects.}}
